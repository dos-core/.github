# dos-core
dos-core GitHub is a collection of Open Source MS/PC DOS compatible core operating system files, specifically the kernel (KERNEL.SYS, IO.SYS/DOS.SYS, ...), shell (COMMAND.COM), and system installer (SYS).  

# status / goals
Currently the repositories here are just mirrors of others.  In the future releases will include downloadable binaries to enable using the kernels as basis of your own boot disk / DOS distribution.
